This repository contains previous jupyter notebooks with our studies and the current project.

This course introduces artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques with applications to the tomography of the nucleon. Students will learn how to analyze data to visualize the internal structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons). The course will cover foundational Python programming, neural networks, and the use of PyTorch to construct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). These methods will be applied to nuclear physics data for tomography, with a special focus on creating visual models that describe the nucleon's internal structure.
